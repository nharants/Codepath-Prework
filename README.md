Submitted by: **Nate Harants**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/held-bittersweet-mortarboard?path=README.md%3A1%3A0)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I used Tutorialspoint.com for some definitions on basic Javascript functions. I was pretty rusty so I needed to refresh my knowledge.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I was going to do the whole assignment in one go initially, but I kept hitting a wall with the initial pattern. The function for playing a clue refused to work despite everything else working normally. I could not for the life of me figure out what I was doing wrong. I ended up stepping away from the assignment for a day or two and then returning. When I returned I easily found the class tag I had mistyped in the html and fixed. After that the rest of the development went smoothly. This is a wider problem I have faced in my work before, where I find myself getting burnt out or frustrated at a lack of progress. When this happens I end up just trudging along, not actually getting anything done. At my previous internship, I developed a system to help me deal with this. If I had worked for long enough on something, and I was at the point where I wasn’t making any real progress, I would force myself to step away and work on a different task. Usually then I could let my brain forget about it for a while and come back to it with a fresh perspective. Often I would set specific time increments to work on something for one hour and switch to something else afterwards. Of course, this system requires pretty good time management but it has worked for me so far to overcome this problem. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[In my previous experience I have only really dipped my toe into web development. Most of  my experience in CS has been traditional object oriented stuff or data analysis. Web dev is a new frontier for me and it's something I'm excited to sink my teeth into. One thing I am interested in when it comes to Web Development is how it ties into things like databases. I used Tableau to pull data from a data warehouse at my previous position but I never got the chance to do that in the context of web development. I've also been interested in some of the UX design principles that go into the frontend of a website. Ux design is something I was always interested in when it came to CS disciplines and it would be cool to see those applied. One of my tasks at my previous internship was to find potential problems and confusing layouts in our company's website, and there were a lot of minor inconveniences that made navigating it a chore. Lastly, I was hoping to learn more about the maintenance of a specific website. I have done a bit of TCP/IP network stuff in my classes but havent really had an opportunity to use that more practically. All in all, I am open to most everything that the web development process has to offer.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time to work on this project I would want to make it more gamelike. I was thinking of adding a leaderboard that shows the record score. I was also thinking about giving the game multiple difficulty options, probably affecting the time you have to answer and the length of the pattern. For simplicity’s sake, it would probably be endless, lasting until you screw up. Then it would record your score on the leaderboard. The difficulty settings could affect the speed and how much leeway you have to answer them. The leaderboard could possibly have a sort function. While we are changing the speed of the clue sequence, may as well have it randomly slow up and down to mess with the player’s rhythm. The game would still be pretty simple at its core, but it could end up more enjoyable and game like.]
